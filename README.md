Gas Price CVaR Calculator
This Python script calculates the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for gas prices from a CSV file containing historical gas price data.

Dependencies
pandas
numpy
You can install the required packages using the following command:

Copy code
pip install pandas numpy
Data
The gas price data is read from the CSV file named 'GasPrices2023.csv'. The CSV file should contain a column labeled 'Close', representing the closing prices of gas for the given time period.

CVaR Calculation
CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) is a measure of the risk of an investment. It represents the expected loss given that the loss exceeds a certain threshold. In this script, we calculate CVaR at a specified confidence level.

The steps for CVaR calculation are as follows:

Read gas prices from the CSV file.
Sort the gas prices in ascending order.
Calculate the CVaR index as (1 - confidence_level) * num_samples.
Compute the CVaR as the mean of the sorted prices up to the CVaR index.
Usage
Prepare the CSV file 'GasPrices2023.csv' with the historical gas price data.
Execute the Python script to calculate the CVaR for the gas prices at the desired confidence level.
Example
python
Copy code
# Read gas prices from CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('GasPrices2023.csv')
gas_prices = df['Close'].values

# Calculate CVaR
confidence_level = 0.95  # Set the desired confidence level
sorted_prices = np.sort(gas_prices)
num_samples = len(sorted_prices)
cvar_index = int((1 - confidence_level) * num_samples)
cvar = np.mean(sorted_prices[:cvar_index])

# Print CVaR result
print(f"CVaR at {confidence_level*100}% confidence level: {cvar}")
